# NodeJS-TypeScript-Babel-Jest

This is fork from [microsoft TS Babel starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter)

Its a pre-configured Typescript with Jest project, which can be used for writing code (may be try out modules) in typescript as well as write tests.

# Motivation

I wanted to have starter code with pre-configured typescript and Jest.

I dont have much experience but this seems to be a good starting point and will improve upon suggestions.
